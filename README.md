# How I Used Tinder to Match with People Abroad — And How 9Proxy Made It Way Easier

So, I recently got curious about meeting people on Tinder outside my own country. Honestly, it felt a bit tricky at first because Tinder usually shows you matches nearby, right? But I wanted to expand my horizons, maybe connect with someone in a totally different time zone, culture, and vibe.

Here’s the catch: Tinder detects your location through your IP address, so if you’re physically in one country, you only see local profiles. At first, I tried messing with VPNs, but the [connection](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=web20&utm_id=donne123) was slow or unstable, and sometimes Tinder flagged it. That’s when a friend told me about [9Proxy](https://9proxy.com/?utm_source=web20&utm_id=donne123) — a [proxy service](https://9proxy.com/) designed exactly for this kind of situation.
